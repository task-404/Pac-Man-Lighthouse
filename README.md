This README provides an overview of the Pac-Man game project, which was the culmination of my first programming course.
The project aimed to implement the classic Pac-Man game using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern while integrating it with the Lighthouse API.

Project Overview:
The Pac-Man game project was undertaken to showcase proficiency in Java programming, software design patterns, and API integration.
The project combined the nostalgic gameplay of Pac-Man with modern software architecture concepts.

Features:

Pac-Man Gameplay: The project accurately reproduces the classic Pac-Man gameplay, involving the player navigating Pac-Man through a maze to collect coins and avoid ghosts.

Model-View-Controller (MVC): The project was structured using the MVC design pattern to ensure separation of concerns and modular design. This facilitated ease of development and maintenance.

User Interface: The user interface was designed to mimic the original Pac-Man interface, offering players a nostalgic feel while enjoying the game.

Lighthouse Integration:
The project's standout feature was its integration with the Lighthouse architecture.
The Lighthouse API allowed us to extend the gaming experience beyond the screen.
